## RJ, 2025
My full name is Ryan James Methven, but I just go by [RJ](https://ryme1295.github.io). I am working towards graduate school, and this certificate program is my first step toward that goal. I have worked in the field on Niwot Ridge as a field technician, conducting snow surveys as well as animal surveys, installing and maintaining stream gauges, contributing to limnology research, and collecting biomass and air samples. In Isafjordur, Iceland, I was a research assistant for the meteorological office. I was responsible for organizing snowpit profiles over the past two years to be able to cross-examine other data sets. While I'm in this course, I have been working seasonally in parks and recreation, but im currently at the Boulder Home Depot. 

#### Images of me

This picture was taken during my semester abroad in Iceland. We primarily focused on climate change in the Arctic, and I had the opportunity to work at the Icelandic Meteorological Office during my final project. During my time there, I was exposed to data analysis for snowpack profiles. I wasn't able to work with Python at the time, and I felt limited. This motivated me to pursue this course and become proficient at analyzing data with a more complex and efficient programming language.

This is the Boulder watershed. I had the opportunity to work at the CU Mountain Research Center, where we conducted research on Niwot Ridge and in the Boulder Watershed.

I chose to map Montana State University at Missoula because I would like to attend grad school there after I have more experience with coding.

#### Portfolio Post work

This is a picture of Bozeman Temperatures, dating back to the late 1800s. There is some noisy data at the beginning, possibly due to stations being moved. Beginning in the 1950s, a gradual warming trend was observed, showing more reliable data.
