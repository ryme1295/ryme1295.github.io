## RJ, 2025
My full name is Ryan James Methven, but I just go by [RJ](https://ryme1295.github.io). I am working towards graduate school, and this certificate program is my first step toward that goal. I have worked in the field on Niwot Ridge as a field technician, conducting snow surveys as well as animal surveys, installing and maintaining stream gauges, contributing to limnology research, and collecting biomass and air samples. In Isafjordur, Iceland, I was a research assistant for the meteorological office. I was responsible for organizing snowpit profiles over the past two years to be able to cross-examine other data sets. While I'm in this course, I have been working seasonally in parks and recreation, but im currently at the Boulder Home Depot.

I chose to map Montana State University at Missoula because I would like to attend grad school there after I have more experience with coding.

#### Portfolio Post work

This is a picture of Bozeman Temperatures, dating back to the late 1800s. There is some noisy data at the beginning, possibly due to stations being moved. Beginning in the 1950s, a gradual warming trend was observed, showing more reliable data.
